# Jumia-web-scrapping-with-R
This project describes a web scraping approach to collect product information from Jumia, a popular online marketplace in Nigeria. The project uses R packages such as 'rvest', 'dplyr', 'stringr', 'glue', 'tidyverse', 'RMySQL', and 'DBI' to scrape, manipulate, and store the data. The project defines a function to scrape product details from a given URL and applies it to multiple pages of Jumia's mobile phones category. The scraped data is cleaned and saved in a CSV file and a MySQL database for further analysis. The project results show the distribution of product prices, ratings, discounts, and brands across the scraped data set. The project also performs a unit test on the scraping function to ensure its functionality and reliability. The unit test checks if the function returns a data frame with the expected columns and values for a given URL. The project uses the **testthat** package   for unit testing, which provides various functions and tools for creating and running tests. The project demonstrates how to use web scraping techniques and SQL integration in R to collect and manage online data.
